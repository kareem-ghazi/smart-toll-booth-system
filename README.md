# Smart Toll Booth Detection System 🛣️

An automated toll booth system that utilizes deep learning (YOLO) to detect vehicles and recognize license plates for seamless toll collection.

## 🌟 Overview

The Smart Toll Booth Detection System is designed to automate the process of vehicle identification and toll management. It leverages custom-trained YOLO models to:
1.  **Detect Vehicles:** Identify vehicles as they approach the toll booth.
2.  **Locate License Plates:** Precisely crop license plate regions from vehicle images.
3.  **Recognize Characters:** Perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the license plates to extract the plate number.
4.  **Manage Records:** Track toll transactions in a database with a user-friendly dashboard.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-toll-booth-system.git
    cd smart-toll-booth-system
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

To launch the interactive dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

### Training Models

If you wish to retrain the models with your own data:

*   **License Plate Detection:** `python src/model/lp_model.py`
*   **Character Recognition:** `python src/model/character_model.py`

*Ensure your `data.yaml` files in `src/data/` are correctly configured.*

## ⚙️ Features

*   **Live Camera Feed:** Real-time capture and processing from a webcam.
*   **Media Upload:** Support for processing static images and recorded videos.
*   **Searchable Database:** A clean UI to view, search, and manage toll records.
*   **Dual YOLO Pipeline:** Separated models for high-accuracy detection and recognition.
